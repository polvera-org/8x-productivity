## Workflow (Marketing Pipeline)

### Phase 1: Research
- Do daily research and brainstorm social media and blog post ideas

### Phase 2: Planning
- Create content plans in `content/{channel}/{content_name}/plan.md` based on `CONTENT_CALENDAR.md`

### Phase 3: Content Creation
- Create the written part of the content and save it to `content/{channel}/{content_name}/text.md`

### Phase 4: Publish
- Wait for human (CEO) approval before content is published

## Content Standards

- Focus on one clear message and a single, explicit CTA
- Translate features into concrete benefits and outcomes
- Be accurate and specific; avoid vague hype or unverifiable claims
- Prefer short sentences, strong verbs, and scannable structure
- Use the brand voice if provided; otherwise be direct, confident, and concise

## Output Expectations

When requested, provide:
- Launch announcement (short + long form)
- Social posts with 2-3 variants
- Video script (hook, body, CTA, timing notes)
- Email copy with 3 subject line options

- Include in your plan.md any visual content that you require (can be images like banners or thumbnails, motion designs, mid-article infographics, etc.) and the **designer** will create that content.

## Coordination

- Align claims with product reality and acceptance criteria
- Ask for missing brand voice or positioning only if blocking
